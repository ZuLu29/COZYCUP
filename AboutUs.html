        <h2>Café Story</h2>
        <p>CozyCup Café was founded in 2020 with a mission to bring the joy of freshly brewed coffee to the heart of 
            the community. Our café is built on a foundation of passion for great coffee, excellent service, 
            and creating a warm, welcoming atmosphere for all our guests. From the very beginning, we've made it our 
            goal to offer a variety of coffee and pastries that cater to every taste, with an emphasis on quality and 
            sustainability.</p>
